-Biomedical ultrasound imaging for characterizing tissues
Changes in tissue structure are associated with various diseases. Effective diagnostic techniques are needed to differentiate tissue structure between disease stages. Ultrasound is a relatively low-cost and accessible imaging modality. However, conventional brightness-mode ultrasound imaging provides limited information about tissue structure. The goal of this project is to develop non-conventional quantitative ultrasound backscatter techniques that can be used to assess changes in tissue structure at different disease stages. These techniques extract quantitative information from backscattered signals by compensating for physical and system parameters. Characterization of tissue structure are based on parameters that represent the number, size, and organization of tissue scatterers, which can change due to disease. To achieve our project goal, we will pursue the following objectives. First, we will simulate the quantitative backscatter imaging techniques in the numerical simulation tool MATLAB, and then implement them using a prototype mechanically-scanned ultrasound system. Second, we will develop tissue-mimicking numerical and hydrogel phantoms for validating the proposed ultrasound techniques. Based on the interest and skill-set of the students, the project can be tuned to emphasize either numerical simulations or experimental studies. Skills in MATLAB and/or electronic instrumentation will be helpful for pursuing the project objectives. The expected learning outcomes for students include in-depth experience of biomedical imaging simulations, experimental measurements, and image processing using MATLAB.

-Mechatronics/Bots
In this projects students will Design exciting game-based projects using electronic devices like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, servo and stepper motors, sensors and more. One idea to think you will make a hexapod machine that will mimic the exact motion of real hexapod. Another idea is make a machine and code it such, that it will be like a four-legged robot which mimics a cat.. Yet another idea to think sound waves at ultrasonic frequencies which can be used to levitate objects. Other ideas are a basketball or rc airplane â€“ the list can go on as long and as big as your imagination takes you!
