Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000

select *
from table_names

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000 by id(primary Key), 8927 by name, 9375 by address, 2564 by postal_code
iii. Category = 2643 by business_id
iv. Attribute = 1115 by business_id
v. Review = 10,000 by id
vi. Checkin = 493 by business_id
vii. Photo = 6493 by business_id
viii. Tip = 3979 by business_id
ix. User = 10,000 by id
x. Friend = 11 by user_id
xi. Elite_years = 2780 by user_id

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: "no."

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		No, I don't think so. What I found out is, with 2000 review counts, it only has 253 fans and 3.6 average stars. Where as with 675 review_count, another has 4.06 average stars and 45 fans. One thing I can notice, Gerald got maximum reviews but because of more fans, its average rating fall down to 3.6. Where, Lyn got 675 reviews but because of 45 fans, it has 4.06 average star rating. Fans and review_counts togethet correlated with average_stars but not with each other.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Yes, there are more reviews with the word 'love' as 1780 and 232 with the word 'hate'.

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select count(*)
	from review
	where text LIKE '%love%'

	select count(*)
	from review
	where text LIKE '%hate%'
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	select name, fans
	from user
	order by fans desc
	limit 10

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

		+-----------+------+
		| name      | fans |
		+-----------+------+
		| Amy       |  503 |
		| Mimi      |  497 |
		| Harald    |  311 |
		| Gerald    |  253 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	+-----------+------------------+-------+---------------------+
	| city      | category         | stars | hours               |
	+-----------+------------------+-------+---------------------+
	| Las Vegas | Beauty & Spas    |   2.5 | Saturday|8:00-22:00 |
	| Las Vegas | Restaurants      |   3.0 | Saturday|11:00-0:00 |
	| Las Vegas | Bars             |   3.5 | Saturday|0:00-0:00  |
	| Las Vegas | Health & Medical |   4.0 | Saturday|8:00-12:00 |
	| Las Vegas | Active Life      |   4.5 | Saturday|8:00-16:30 |
	| Las Vegas | Shopping         |   5.0 | Monday|8:00-17:00   |
	+-----------+------------------+-------+---------------------+
	Yeah. For city Las Vegas, in range 2-3 stars have more hours span compared to those of 4-5 stars range.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
	+-----------+------------------+-------+---------------------+
	| city      | category         | stars | sum(b.review_count) |
	+-----------+------------------+-------+---------------------+
	| Las Vegas | Beauty & Spas    |   2.5 |                 294 |
	| Las Vegas | Restaurants      |   3.0 |                2583 |
	| Las Vegas | Bars             |   3.5 |                3072 |
	| Las Vegas | Health & Medical |   4.0 |               47310 |
	| Las Vegas | Active Life      |   4.5 |                3136 |
	| Las Vegas | Shopping         |   5.0 |                 186 |
	+-----------+------------------+-------+---------------------+
	         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.


+--------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+-------+
| name                           | address                     | postal_code | city      | category         | stars |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+-------+
| Walgreens                      | 3808 E Tropicana Ave        | 89121       | Las Vegas | Beauty & Spas    |   2.5 |
| Wingstop                       | 5045 W Tropicana Ave        | 89103       | Las Vegas | Restaurants      |   3.0 |
| Hi Scores - Blue Diamond       | 4785 Blue Diamond Rd        | 89139       | Las Vegas | Bars             |   3.5 |
| Anthem Pediatrics              | 6070 S Rainbow Blvd, Ste 10 | 89118       | Las Vegas | Health & Medical |   4.0 |
| Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center | 1000 Scenic Loop Dr         | 89161       | Las Vegas | Active Life      |   4.5 |
| Desert Medical Equipment       | 3555 W Reno Ave, Ste F      | 89118       | Las Vegas | Shopping         |   5.0 |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+-------+

	Analysing the location data, I got to know that different star ratings came from differet locations.

SQL code used for analysis:

		select b.name
		, b.address
		, b.postal_code
		, b.city
		, c.category
		, b.stars
		, sum(b.review_count)
		, h.hours

		from (business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id)
		inner join hours h on h.business_id = b.id
		where b.city= 'Las Vegas' or c.category = 'Adult'
		group by b.stars
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
         There are more open businesses than closed one. The count statistucs is like this: Open = 8480, closed = 1520.
ii. Difference 2:
		

         Open businesses have more average revieew count than that of closed businesses. The numbers differ are as follows : Open Average review coount is 31.757 and closed average is 23.198.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	/*couting number of records present per catgegory*/
	select count(*)
	, is_open
	, avg(review_count)
	from business
	group by is_open;


	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         I want to analyse Restaurant based business. The questions I have in my mind are: Which Cities have the largest number of restaurants? Their average star rating per city? How many reviews did they get per city? Same for different states as well. Anomalies would be the cities or states which would have high rating in terms of average rating instead of having low review count.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
         The questions I have in my mind are: Which Cities have the largest number of restaurants? Their average star rating per city? How many reviews did they get per city? Same for different states as well. Anomalies would be the cities or states which would have high rating in terms of average rating instead of having low review count.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
	
		Take the city Madinson into count. It has an average star of 4.0 but only 4 reviews. In terms of stars though it has a higher rating, it doesn't have much review counts compared to that of Cleveland.
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

	+-------------+-----------------+-------+------+
	| count(city) | city            |  astr |  src |
	+-------------+-----------------+-------+------+
	|           2 | Mesa            |   4.5 |  396 |
